# API Testing
# UI Testing
# API => Application program interface
# webservices => http => SOAP UI => it will work through http protocol , the data used to flow in XML format
# client and server
# client => who will be utilizing the api
# server => who will be providing data
# XML(Extensible Markup Language)

# Rest API => it supports different protocol and cross-platform , data format supports json,text,xml
# stateless protocol
# we need to test Rest API
# how to test manually => by using Postman tool
# how to test with automation => by using Python with Pytest framework
# Rest API supports with authentication by using bearer token, JTW token ,OAuth

# Json => its key and value format
# API => CRUD
# get => reading data
# post => creating new data
# put  => updating existing data
# patch => updating existing particular field/column data
# delete => deleting data

# status code

# to test API => what is the URL/endpoint , what is the method, what is the response expecting
# what is the authentication

# Response code =>
# 200 series => success response
# 400 series => client error
# 500 series => server error

# query parameter => we will define the field name for which we are passing data by using ?= ,url?page=2
# path parameter => we will append with endpoint and pass through the end point

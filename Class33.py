# Interview Questions
# my self ... , I have total 4+ yrs of experience in testing and currently i am working as automation test
# engineer , my key skills are Python , Pytest , API Testing  , UI Testing by using selenium
# Other than this I have experience in using tools like Postman and Github as version control and with Agile methodology

# How much you will rate your self in Python => 3.5/5 , 7/10
# Pytest => 7/10,3.5/5
# Selenium => 3.5/5,7/10

# Python
# 1)what are the data type available in Python => Primitive datatype, Sequence data types
#  String,float,int,bool => Primitive
# List,tuple ,set,dict => Sequence
# 2) what is the difference between list and tuple , tuple and dictionary , list and dictionary
# list is mutable type
# tuple is immutable
# 3) what is dictionary => its key and value pair ,
# is keys are mutable => immutable
# can I use list as key in dictionary => we can't because its mutable
# tuple  => can be used as key
# 4) what is set => it will not allow duplicates, and it has some functions like union,intersection
# 5) wht is slicing => to get some set of data from list by using start index ,end index and step size
# 6) what is negative indexing => it will start with -1 in reverse direction
# 7) what are the different type of arguments in function ?
# Positional,keyword,default,arbitrary arguments ,keyword arbitrary
# 8) what is the order of these arguments
# 9) what is difference between return , yield ,break
# 10) what is the use of pass
# 11) can we write elif ,else without if? => No
# 12) what is decorator => extending the functionality of function without modifying
# 13) what is closure function => if we use parameter which is passed to function insider another function
# even if we close outside function , still the parameter will be accessible inside function
# 14) what is generator => by using yield keyword instead of returning complete data one time , it will use
# yield keyword and throw data and proceed furthe
# 15) what is args and kwargs and difference between these two
# 16) oops => explain oops => class, object, abstraction , encapsulation ,polymorphism,inheritance
# is python supports overloading => No , but we can acheive by using args or kwargs or multipledispatch module
# is python supports overriding => yes
# what is over riding => defining same method in child class
# 17) what are the types of inheritance python supports => single ,multilevel , multiple
# 18) in Multiple if two parent has same method which one child will take => MRO (method resolution order)
# 19) what are the magic/special/inbuilt methods => these are the inbuilt methods like __init__ ,__del__
# 20) what is __init__
# 21) what is self
# 22) can i use different name for self => we can use any name its just a parameter name
# 23) what are the different types of methods => instance methods,class methods,static methods
# 24) what is class variable , instance variable
# 25) difference between abstraction and encapsulation
# 26) how we will make variable or method as private in python => __ (double underscore)
# 27) API => what are the basic things required for api => method type (get,post,put,patch,delete),
# endpoint (url), headers (authorization,contenttype), payload(if it is post or put,patch)
# 28) which tool you are using manually to test => post
# 29) what is environment variable in postman => once we define this variable we can use as parameter in
#  the url
# 30) what is get ,post,put,patch,delete
# 31) difference between post ,put ,patch
# 32) what are the authorization methods you are aware => Bearer token , JWT token
# 33) what is the validity of this token => mostly for 24hrs
# 34) what is the module your using for api automation or how your automating => requests module
# 35) what are the status codes available => mostly we will use
# 200 series => success => 200,201,202
# 400 series => client error => 400 ,401,403 ,404
# 500 series => server error =>
# 36) Pytest => what is this framework , explain
# its built on top of unit test framework , it will automatically identify the test files ,methods,classes
# file names which are starting with test_ , will automatically consider as test file
# method or class name which starts with test will be consider test method
#  how will execute test case pytest -v
# why -v => it will give indetail information
# what is mark
# what is parametrize
# what is fixture
# what is confest.py
# how will execute grouped test cases  => pytest -m groupname
# what is smoke testing
# what is regression testing
# what is sanity
# what is test plan and test strategy
# how will execute particular test case => pytest -k testcasename
# Selenium
# what is page object model framework
# what is webdriver
# what are the locators/selectors => ID , NAME,CLASSNAME,CSSSELECTOR,XPATH
# what is the difference between absolute and relative xpath
# which is faster locator => Css selector
# which is slowest locator => XPath
# difference between findelement and findelements
# how will make as syncronization in selenium => by using wait concepts
# implicit wait, explicit wait ,fluent wait
# difference between driver.close and quit
# how will perform mouse related movements  => ActionChains
# how will read data from drop down
# how will execute javascript by using driver => driver.execute script
# how to take screen shot
# how to perform right click

# coding
# reverse string without using inbuilt functions
# reverse number without converting into string
# find the largest element in array/list
# find the second-largest element in list
# find number of characters repeated in string => display and key and value ,key as character and value as count
# write code for factorial of number
# write code for fibonacci series of number
# write code to print first 50 prime numbers
# print string as aaaabbbbccd => 4a3b2c1d
